I had the opportunity to test the website, where I was asked to calculate my daily calorie needs and energy expenditure during various physical activities. The site looks nice, intuitive interface, all buttons are easy to press, there is an explanation for each stage. I tried to add a few types of physical activity that I usually do. It was interesting to see the energy expenditure during these exercises. I think this development will be useful for those who play sports professionally and need a detailed analysis of calorie intake and expenditure, as well as for people who want to lose or gain weight. 
However I didn't find HIIT, that I usually do, but succeeded with running. Would benice to see the whole list of activities.
