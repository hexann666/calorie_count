the layout is very understandble on the first glance. 
What is a little confusing is that the large juicy picture in the middle is distracting from the first reading of the description text. 
The description text is very clear, however I think it might be even easier to read if some key words in each paragraph would be hilghlighted. However, this might be my millenial's problems reaching out.
after "you entered following body parameters" would be cool to have the simplified outputs, without { and ". 
the choice of activity worked for me by simply typing in the name,  but would be very nice to actually beable to scroll through the whole list as well. If there already is such an option, I did not succeed in finding it. 
all in one - very intuitive run-through, in my opinion. Also, always actually wanted to calculate those indexes precisely, but always was to lazy to search for those activities values. Great that someone did it instead!
