## Self reflection after completing Lab 1

I definetely didn't go the easy path, when deciding to do the project by myself. What I wanted to achieve is to see, if it is possible to create a solid infrastructure for a single person project in a short amount of time and nbdev library was an excellent advice to make this achievable. 

Work on Lab 1 showed, how much work usually gets lost while only concentrating on the correct functions in Jupyter notebook - docs, CI pipeline, repository structure, package and releases were never in scope of our study projects to this extend up until now, and it was a breakthrough to estimate additional amount of time, that is needed to achieve some solid level for this "side tasks". It definetely gave more understanding of technical aspects around traditional ML tasks and made clear, that knowledge of software development basics is helpful for any data scientist, who wants to make her projects humen-accessible.

I think it was a right decision to pick up a very simple piece of code as a base for the project, because with all additional tasks apart of main functionality I wouldn't be able to perform some complicated coding. Still I consider, that the small application I am working on gives me enough challenges due to its functions and implementatiom, eg. writing tests and checks for user input was an interesting task and brought a lot of new knowledge, handling checks of different types of input values.

Thinking of the code in the user-centered way helped me to find more room for optimization to make the application more intuitiv, get rid or automatize some operations, like eg. making printing out the results of calculations as part of function and not just calculating and returning the results.

As I am a fan of writing tasks down, having a project board definetely was a useful tool for structuring the work. I would say I had rather Kanban than Scrum, as due to my actual work the amount of time and it being distributed doesn't allow to have a well planned scrum sprints. I still think, that the time and task planning went well and was helpful.

I am looking forward to the the next chapter to try to write this code for a streamlit application. Also I started a container in this lab, but didn't use all of its advantages until now, so that's something I want to do on the coming releases of calorie count.
