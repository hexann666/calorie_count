## Self reflection after completing Lab 2

This part of the project was very interesting, as I never used Python to create a website. Streamlit provides a perfect base for easy start, it has good documentation and it i popular enough to have all of my major issues already addressed in their github troubleshooting or on stackoverflow.

As I knew interface too well, I decided to ask some people, who have never seen my application, to test it online and write me their impressions. It allowed to spotlight some aspects, that made the use less intuitive and by fixing them the app deinitely became better. I think, it was very important to get a second oppinion, as it is hard to stay objective, when you spend so much time thinking about the app and know, how and what it should do.
