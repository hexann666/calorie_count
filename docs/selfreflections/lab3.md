## Self reflection after completing Lab 3

Although the use of a data base was not necessarily needed for functionality of the app, it gave a chance to practice establishing connection with an API. In this case, Notion was selected as data base storage environment.

The whole process showed, that although the setting up of environment, keys, token etc might not need much time, there are always some pitfalls on the way. In my case they were different data types, that are stored in the columns and various structures of json file, that signal the API, that input data should be stored as number/text/categories etc.

Security was another issue, with tokens and ids being part of the code, but Streamlit provides a very useful solution for this, which is quite easy to implement.

All in all, this part was a good add-on to the whole project and allowed me to try out additional tools, that might be helpful in the future. Even if I will not work with Notion data bases, the API setup with requests and adding an antry with specific json structure is similar for different providers.

I think this project was a very good possibility to practice use of different tools to create an infrastructure around a piece of code, turning it into a running app. It gave a possibility to compare tools and reflect on what app specialities or project setup can influence their choice.
