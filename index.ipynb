    "The aim of the project is to build a web application, where users can type in their body parameters and get an estimation of their recommended daily calories intake. In the second step users can provide information about the type of their sport activity and time they were doing it and get a calculation of spent calories during this activity.\n",

    "- System shall provide input fields for the input parameters (height, weight, age, gender, activity level).\n",
    "- User should input the body parameters in the order, in which system will request them and confirm that the input is complete.\n",
    "- System should store the variables provided by user until the end of transaction.\n",

    "After choosing your usual level of activity the Active Metabolic Rate, the number of calories that we consume on a daily basis depending on our height, gender, age, weight and entered activity level whilst maintaining current weight, will be calculated. Output of the function should be stored in a variable to pass it to the next function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Than you will be asked to type in the activity you were doing today. If there are more than one activities matching your input, you will select one from the lst that matches your search pattern. Additionally you will enter the time you were doing this activity.\n",
